# Ansible

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source automation platform that simplifies IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and cloud provisioning. It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to describe automation jobs, allowing for easy and efficient management of IT infrastructure. Ansible operates without the need for an agent, utilizing SSH for communication, which streamlines the setup process and reduces overhead. Its modular architecture supports a wide range of modules for different systems and applications, making it highly versatile and adaptable to various environments. Overall, Ansible enhances operational efficiency, consistency, and scalability in managing complex IT workflows.

## Ansible vs Terraform

Ansible and Terraform are both powerful tools used for automation in IT environments, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. Ansible is better at managing configuration while Terraform is more suited for infrastructure provisioning. Therefore, it is very common to see both tools being used together in a complementary manner to achieve comprehensive automation across the entire IT stack.
